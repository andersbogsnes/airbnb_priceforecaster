# Airbnb pricing forecaster 

# Background
We are working at company that helps people who want to rent out their apartment on AirBnB. We are a full-service 
company that takes care of everything from photography to cleaning to keys.

## The problem

When new potential renters come to our website, they want to know how much money they could make from renting their
apartment through us. 

## The solution
We are going to build an app that will take an address and ask some questions, and will return an estimate for how much
you could make per day (minus our cut of course!)

# Installation instructions
We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our packages. If you have poetry installed, you can run
`poetry install` and everything should be working fine.

## Getting the data
The data is sourced from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html - a scraping project which scrapes publically
available AirBnB data and publishes it. They take snapshots of the data at a given time, which we can then download.
