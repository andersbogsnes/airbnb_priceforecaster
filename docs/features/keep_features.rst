house_rules

What rules the guest must follow. Would try to extract some simple rules such as smoking allowed or similar

House rules will be used to extract features from, such as `is_no_smoking` or something indicating a lot of rules
dtype: string

host_since
==========
When started hosting. Hypothesis that being a host for longer affects the price - they might be able to charge a different price.
For our solution, we can set it to 0 or ask.

Is a date - note that date is not a dtype, but we can set read_csv to parse it automatically as a date
dtype: datetime

Text of where the host is located. Could be used to extract features from
dtype: string


host_response_time
==================
How long does it take for the host to accept/decline an offer. Hypothesis that this could be an indicator of "seriousness" which could affect the price

Categorical with 4 levels
dtype: category

host_neighbourhood
==================
Where the host lives. Hypothesis that this could indicate "awayness", which could affect the price

Text of where the host is located. Could be used to extract features from
dtype: string


host_listings_count
===================
How many listings they have. Hypothesis that this could be an indicator of "seriousness" which could affect the price

Is a count, so an integer
dtype: Int64


host_total_listings_count
=========================
Unsure how this is different from above.

Is a count, so an integer
dtype: Int64


host_verifications
==================
What communication verifications does the host have. Hypothesis that more/specific types of validated communcations increases confidence

Is an array in string form. Need to read as string and preprocess
dtype: string


host_has_profile_pic
====================
Does the host have a profile picture? Hypothesis that this could increase confidence and thus price

Is a bool, but represented as 't'/'f'. Read as string and preprocess
dtype: string

host_identity_verified
======================
Is the host verified. Hypothesis that this increases confidence and thus price

Is a bool, but represented as 't'/'f'. Read as string and preprocess
dtype: string


neighbourhood
=============
The area which the host writes.

Is a categorical of each neighbourhood
dtype: category


zipcode
=======
Zipcode (postnr) of the location

It's a common pitfall to convert to a number, but there is a possibility of a leading zero. This is very rare and only applies to old zipcodes and some military installations. [reference](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnumre_i_Danmark)

To be certain, this should either be a categorical or a string, but an int should be OK for this usecase.

In this case, we are getting errors, since some of the zipcodes are missing. In addition, some of the zipcodes are not numbers, such as '2400 Kbh NV' or '2100 Ã¸'. These need to be cleaned up as well. We need to import it as str to begin with
dtype: string

=========
Approximate longitude

Categorical
dtype: category


accommodates

dtype: Int8

dtype: Int64


instant_bookable
================
Whether or not the location is "instant bookable", an ease-of-use feature. Should make for a more popular rental and better price
